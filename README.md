# Encrypted Cloud-Based Neural Network Controller for a Differential-Drive Robot

This repository accompanies the paper **"Encrypted Cloud-Based Neural Network Controller for a Differential-Drive Robot"**.

The experiment studies trajectory tracking for a differential-drive robot using a remote controller. The robot acts as the client: it computes a six-element tracking feature vector from its current state and the reference trajectory, then sends a request to an inference server. Three controller modes are evaluated with the same Webots setup:

- **Kanayama**: the server evaluates the analytic Kanayama tracking controller.
- **Plaintext NN**: the server evaluates a neural network trained to imitate the Kanayama controller.
- **CKKS NN**: the robot encrypts the normalized feature vector with CKKS, the server performs the neural-network inference on encrypted data, and the robot decrypts the returned control command locally.

The neural network is trained offline from Webots rollouts generated with the Kanayama controller. The final evaluation uses an unseen Lissajous trajectory and compares tracking performance, wheel commands, server processing time, and client-observed round-trip time.

## Experiment configuration

### Robot and controller

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Webots simulation step | 10 ms |
| Control update period | 100 ms |
| Wheel radius | 0.04445 m |
| Wheelbase | 0.393 m |
| Wheel-speed limit | +/-10 rad/s |
| Kanayama gains | `Kx=2.0`, `Ky=9.0`, `Ktheta=6.0` |

The six neural-network inputs are:

```text
[e_x, e_y, e_theta, v_ref, v_robot, omega_ref]
```

The two outputs are the right and left wheel commands:

```text
[wr, wl]
```

### Training data

The training dataset uses eight reference trajectories:

```text
lemniscate
circle
rounded_square
spiral
rose
clover
hypotrochoid
random_spline
```

The Lissajous trajectory is **not** used for training. It is reserved for the final evaluation.

Dataset settings:

- 40 rollouts per training trajectory
- random seed: `42`
- position perturbation: `+/-0.3 m`
- heading perturbation: `+/-0.7 rad`
- velocity perturbation: `+/-0.10 m/s`
- expected dataset size: **192,680 feature-target pairs**

### Neural network

- architecture: `6 -> 64 -> 2`
- activation: `p(z) = z + 0.125 z^2`
- optimizer: AdamW
- epochs: `16`
- batch size: `1024`
- learning rate: `3e-3`
- weight decay: `1e-5`

### CKKS

- polynomial modulus degree: `8192`
- coefficient modulus bits: `[40, 30, 30, 30, 30, 40]`
- global scale: `2^30`
- Galois keys: enabled
- relinearization keys: enabled

### Evaluation

- unseen trajectory: 50 s Lissajous path
- measured control requests: 501 (`t = 0.0, 0.1, ..., 50.0 s`)
- two additional warm-up requests are executed before the measured run

For the paper experiment, the Webots client and the inference server ran on the same workstation and communicated through the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`).

# Reproducing the experiment

## 1. Install the dependencies

Install the packages from the repository root:

```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check the main dependencies:

```bat
python -c "import numpy, scipy, torch; print('NumPy/SciPy/PyTorch OK')"
```

For CKKS, also check TenSEAL:

```bat
python -c "import tenseal; print('TenSEAL OK')"
```

The Webots Python controller must use a Python environment in which the required packages are installed.

---

## 2. Collect the Webots training dataset

Webots is configured to execute:

```text
Webots/controllers/robot_controller/robot_controller.py
```

For data collection, overwrite that file with `data_collector.py`:

```bat
copy /Y data_collector.py Webots\controllers\robot_controller\robot_controller.py
```

Open the following world in Webots:

```text
Webots/world/world.wbt
```

Reset the simulation and run it in **fast mode (`>>`)**. The collector prints occasional progress messages while it processes the eight trajectories and 40 rollouts per trajectory.

When collection is complete, the following file is created:

```text
Webots/webots_dataset.npz
```

The expected number of samples is:

```text
192680
```

Copy the dataset to the repository root so that it is next to `train.py`:

```bat
copy /Y Webots\webots_dataset.npz webots_dataset.npz
```

At this point the repository root should contain:

```text
train.py
webots_dataset.npz
```

---

## 3. Train and export the neural network

Run:

```bat
python train.py
```

The script loads `webots_dataset.npz`, calculates the normalization values, trains the neural network, and creates:

```text
model_export.json
```

Keep this file in the repository root because `server.py` reads it there by default.

The Webots client also needs the same model file for the normalization values. Copy it into the Webots folder:

```bat
copy /Y model_export.json Webots\model_export.json
```

You should now have:

```text
model_export.json
Webots/model_export.json
```

These two files must be identical.

---

## 4. Switch Webots from data collection to evaluation

Replace the active Webots controller with `client.py`:

```bat
copy /Y client.py Webots\controllers\robot_controller\robot_controller.py
```

Reset Webots after replacing the controller file.

The evaluation client draws the Lissajous reference path directly in the Webots world, so no separate trajectory object needs to be added to `world.wbt`.

---

## 5. Start the inference server

Open a terminal in the repository root and run:

```bat
python server.py
```

Keep this terminal open while Webots is running.

Default connection:

```text
server address: 127.0.0.1
port: 50007
```

The server runs in `auto` mode by default and accepts the mode requested by the client.

For plaintext and CKKS modes, make sure `model_export.json` is next to `server.py`.

---

## 6. Run the three controller modes

The evaluation client supports:

```text
kanayama
plaintext
ckks
```

The active Webots controller contains a line equivalent to:

```python
MODE = os.environ.get("AMR_MODE", "kanayama").lower()
```

The most direct method on Windows is to change the default string before each run:

```python
"kanayama"
```

then:

```python
"plaintext"
```

then:

```python
"ckks"
```

Reset Webots before every new run.

For each mode:

1. make sure `server.py` is running;
2. select the desired client mode;
3. reset the Webots simulation;
4. start the simulation;
5. wait for the complete 50 s run;
6. wait for the client to save the result file;
7. wait for the server to detect the disconnect and save its processing-time file.

The Webots client produces:

```text
Webots/run_data_webots_kanayama.npz
Webots/run_data_webots_plaintext.npz
Webots/run_data_webots_ckks.npz
```

The server produces:

```text
server_processing_times_kanayama.npz
server_processing_times_plaintext.npz
server_processing_times_ckks.npz
```

The server timing files include the two startup warm-up requests. `scripts/results.py` excludes them when calculating the measured results.

---

## 7. Collect the result files

Copy the three Webots run files to the repository root:

```bat
copy /Y Webots\run_data_webots_kanayama.npz run_data_webots_kanayama.npz
copy /Y Webots\run_data_webots_plaintext.npz run_data_webots_plaintext.npz
copy /Y Webots\run_data_webots_ckks.npz run_data_webots_ckks.npz
```

Before running the result script, the repository root should contain:

```text
run_data_webots_kanayama.npz
run_data_webots_plaintext.npz
run_data_webots_ckks.npz

server_processing_times_kanayama.npz
server_processing_times_plaintext.npz
server_processing_times_ckks.npz
```

---

## 8. Display the results

Run:

```bat
python scripts/results.py
```

The script:

- prints RMSE, mean position error, and maximum position error for the three controllers;
- prints the server processing and client-observed round-trip timing summaries;
- prints the CKKS timing breakdown;
- displays the trajectory comparison;
- displays the tracking-error comparison;
- displays the right- and left-wheel speed comparison.

The script only displays the figures; it does not save image files.

Timing values depend on the hardware, operating-system scheduling, and machine load, so they are not expected to exactly match the values obtained on the paper test machine.
